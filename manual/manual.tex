\section{Ebi: introduction}
	Ebi is a process mining tool, ProM plug-in and library, and is focused on stochastic process mining algorithms.
	Ebi works completely offline and installation is in most cases not necessary.
		
	A command is an algorithm in Ebi that a user can call.
	Ebi has \numberofcommands{} commands; for an overview of commands please refer to Section~\ref{sec:commands} or give the command-line parameter \verb=--help=.
	\numberoffilehandlers{} different types of files are supported; Section~\ref{sec:filehandlers} contains an overview of the files that Ebi supports.
	
	The architecture of Ebi and how to develop new commands can be found in Section~\ref{sec:architecture}.
	
	\subsection{Command-line application}
		Ebi can be used as a stand-alone command-line application; installation is not necessary.
		
		On Windows, simply download the executable from \url{http://ebitools.org} and run it from a console.
		
		On Linux, simply download the executable from \url{http://ebitools.org}, give the file execution permissions, and run it from a console.
		
		On Mac OS X, self-compilation is required. 
		Please refer to \url{http://ebitools.org} and click through to the source code for a getting-started of 5 easy steps.
		
	\subsection{ProM plug-in}
		Ebi can be used as a plug-in of the ProM framework~\cite{DBLP:conf/bpm/VerbeekBDA10} (\url{https://promtools.org}) on Windows and Linux. 
		ProM does not support Mac OS X.
		
		To install, open the ProM Package Manager and install the \verb=Ebi= package.
		Then, a selection of Ebi commands can be run, just as any other ProM plug-in.
		
		The following commands are available as ProM plug-ins:
		\promcommands
	
	\subsection{Speed tricks}
	\label{sec:speedtricks}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
			\label{speedtrick:multithreaded}
			If Ebi uses all CPU cores and runs out of RAM, one can try to reduce the CPU cores that Ebi will use by setting the environment variable \verb!RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1! or some other desired number of cores.
			This will trade run time for RAM in multi-threaded algorithms.

			\item By default, Ebi uses exact arithmetic for most commands.
			To disable this, provide the \verb=-a= parameter.
			The results are then not guaranteed, but it may be faster.

   			\item By default, Ebi is compiled with support for both exact and approximate arithmetic, and the user can select the arithmetic with the \verb=-a= parameter.
            However, this comes with a performance penalty.
            By selecting one of the features \verb=exactarithmetic= or \verb=approximatearithmetic=, the arithmetic is chosen at compilation time, yielding a performance benefit.

            To do this, use \verb=cargo run --features exactarithmetic=, but a faster binary is obtained by compiling for release: \verb=cargo build --release --features exactarithmetic=.
		\end{enumerate}

\section{Commands}
\label{sec:commands}

	This section lists the commands supported by Ebi.

\section{Supported files}
\label{sec:filehandlers}
	This section lists the file types that are supported by Ebi, and for each file type which commands can use it as input or produce it as output.
	
    Please note that Ebi does not consider input file extensions.
    Instead, it will attempt to parse the input file in all of the formats that are supported by the called command.
    For plug-ins with multiple output file formats, the file extension is used to determine the output format.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

    \subsection{Files and objects}
        Figure~\ref{fig:traits} shows the main architectural concepts of Ebi with regards to files and objects.
        It's a bit verbose, but it enables commands to be completely detached from any I/O, and reduces overhead when adding new functionality, and guarantees the documentation is up-to-date.

        \subsubsection{Commands}
            A command is a function of Ebi that users can call.
            A command declares what types of inputs it needs and what type of output it generates. 
            Preferably, commands take traits as inputs rather than object types.
    
            Commands can circumvent the Ebi object handling on their inputs by declaring an \texttt{cli\_command} function, which gives direct access to the command line interface building process.
            This is for instance used in the \ebiCommand{validate} command, where we want to obtain the parsing error for a particular object type.
    
            The actual input for a command gets wrapped in the \texttt{EbiInput} enum, and the output must be wrapped in the \texttt{EbiOutput} enum.
            The Ebi machinery verifies whether the output of a command matches the declared output type at run time.
            
            Commands define a number of inputs, and for each input a list of acceptable types.
            However, these types need to be similar: a command cannot ask for either a file and a fraction, for instance.
    
            Ebi has the following commands:
            \ebicommandlist
    
        \subsubsection{Input types}
            An input type is a declaration of what a command needs as input.
            An input type can be:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a trait;
                \item an object type;
                \item a basic data type such as fraction, integer or string;
                \item the ``any object" input type, which denotes that any object type will be accepted;
                \item a ``file handler", which indicates the (name of) a file handler (for instance used in the \ebiCommand{validate} command).
            \end{itemize}
    
            The actual input for a command gets wrapped in the \texttt{EbiInput} enum.
    
        \subsubsection{Traits}
        \label{sec:traits}
            A ``trait" is like an interface: it provides some functions but does not say how these are implemented.
            For instance ``finite stochastic language" is a trait, which allows to iterate over traces and their probabilities, and to obtain the number of traces.
            Preferably, commands should require traits as inputs.

            Ebi has the following traits:
            \ebitraitlist
    
        \subsubsection{Object types}
        \label{sec:objecttypes}
            An object type is a struct or class.
            It is a specific implementation with a fixed data structure.
            The output of a command is an object of a specific object type.
            The input of a command rather not uses object types, but sometimes this is unavoidable.
            Objects are wrapped in an \texttt{EbiObject} enum to ensure type safety by the compiler.

            Ebi has the following object types:
            \ebiobjecttypelist
    
        \subsubsection{File handlers}
            A file handler is an importer for a particular file format.
            In Ebi, a file handler defines how a file type is to be handled, and as which objects and traits it can be imported, and which objects can be exported to it.
    
            Ebi has the following file handlers:
            \ebifilehandlerlist
            
		\subsubsection{ProM support}
			Ebi automatically exports the commands it supports to ProM.
			A command is automatically supported if:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The command does not access the command line directly.
				That is, \verb=cli_command= of the command must be \verb=None=.
				\item There is a combination of inputs to the command that are all supported by ProM.
				The following input types are supported by ProM:
				\ebiprominput
				
				\item The output of the command is supported by ProM.
				The following output types are supported by ProM:
				\ebipromoutput
			\end{enumerate}
			For each combination of input parameter types and output types, one plug-in is added to ProM automatically.
            
	\subsection{Implementing a new command/algorithm/technique}
	\label{sec:implement}
		There are two steps to take: set up the technique (that is, the implementation), and set up the command (i.e. where \& how Ebi can call it).
		
		\subsubsection{Conventions and Hints}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Ebi only uses floating point numbers (f32, f64) when the user asks for it.
				Commands should use \verb=Fraction= or other exact numeric classes (see Section~\ref{sec:exact}); these perform computations with the arithmetic type selected by the user.
				\item It is important that errors are propagated appropriately.
				Therefore, avoid \verb=.unwrap()= but instead propagate errors using \verb=.with_context(|| "error message")?=.
				The \verb=anyhow= package formats the error messages nicely to the user.
				\item For speed considerations, avoid .clone(), but use references instead, especially on heap-based structs such as \verb=Fraction=.
				\item \verb|a += b| is usually faster than \verb|c = a + b|, as it saves a memory allocation, especially on heap-based structs such as \verb=Fraction=.
				\item Rather than using a numeric struct, using traits such as \verb=Add= and \verb=Mul= allows code to be used regardless of the arithmetic type.
				\item To provide debug output, avoid \verb=println= as it prevents piping of results, but use \verb=log::info()= or \verb=log::debug()= instead.
				For consistency, Ebi provides two types of progress bars: one where a total integer number of steps is available, and one where a message is used that can be updated, e.g. to denote a probability:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, style=boxed]
EbiCommand::get_progress_bar_ticks(total_steps);
EbiCommand::get_progress_bar_message(message);
\end{lstlisting}
                \item Compilation for release will fail if there are any warnings.
			\end{enumerate}
            
		\subsubsection{The technique}
			The technique is the place where the code for the algorithm lives.
			This should go in its own file in the \verb=techniques= folder.
			As an example, we'll use the unit Earth Movers' Stochastic Conformance, (uEMSC) which takes a finite stochastic language (log) and a queriable stochastic language (model), and returns a fraction to indicate the conformance of the log and model.
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item First, decide on the input and output of your technique.
				
				For the inputs, preferably use Ebi traits for the inputs whenever possible: as the framework expands, all new objects and files will be automatically supported by your technique.
				See Section~\ref{sec:traits} for an overview of Ebi traits.
				Alternatively, object types can be used as inputs; please see Section~\ref{sec:objecttypes} for an overview of available object types.
				
				For our example, uEMSC needs to walk through a finite set of traces (EbiTraitFiniteStochasticLanguage) and needs to ask the model for a probability of each trace (EbiTraitQueriableStochasticLanguage).
				
				For the output: Ebi supports only a single output.
				Ebi deliberately does not support floating point numbers (f32, f64) as these are not exact (see Section~\ref{sec:exact}).
				
				For our example, the output of uEMSC is a fraction.
				
				\item Second, create a Rust trait that will contain the method to call.
				The idea is that this trait will be implemented on one of the Ebi traits, such that it can be called for each Rust struct for which it is available.
				
				For our example, we define a Rust trait that will be implemented on the log (that is, \texttt{self} will be the log):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, style=boxed]
use anyhow::Result;

pub trait UnitEarthMoversStochasticConformance {
    fn unit_earth_movers_stochastic_conformance(
    	&self, 
    	language2: Box<dyn EbiTraitQueriableStochasticLanguage>
    ) -> Result<Fraction>;
}
\end{lstlisting}				
				
				 \item Third, implement the new Rust trait for the appropriate struct and/or trait.
				 
				 For our example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, style=boxed]
impl UnitEarthMoversStochasticConformance 
for dyn EbiTraitFiniteStochasticLanguage {
    fn unit_earth_movers_stochastic_conformance(
    	&self, 
    	mut language2: Box<dyn EbiTraitQueriableStochasticLanguage>
    ) -> Result<Fraction> {   
    	... here comes the algorithm ...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

				In case the inputs involve the Ebi traits \texttt{EbiTraitSemantics}, \texttt{EbiTraitStochasticSemantics} or \texttt{EbiTraitStochasticDeterministicSemantics} (or any other Ebi-trait-that-is-actually-an-enum), one more step is necessary: one has to implement the new Rust trait (e.g. \texttt{UnitEarthMoversStochasticConformance}) for these enums, as well as for the actual trait.
				An example of this can be found in the file \verb=techniques\align.rs=.
			\end{enumerate}
			
		\subsubsection{The command}
			Having implemented the algorithm, Ebi needs to be made aware of the new technique, by creating commands for it.
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Identify the position in the command tree where your command will live.
				This tree can be found in the \verb=ebi_commands= folder.
				By convention, first-level sub-commands (such as \verb=Ebi conformance=) get their own file, and this file contains all commands within that sub-command.
				
				\item Add a new command to this file.
				Most of the fields are self-explanatory, and we explain the key ones here:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \verb=latex_link= will end up in the manual, and can be used to cite a paper where the algorithm is explained.
					
					\item \verb=cli_command= provides access to the command line interface arguments that the user provided.
					This should be \verb=None= for the far majority of plug-ins.
					If it is not \verb=None=, then the command will not be callable from external libraries (such as ProM, PM4PY or Knime).
					Furthermore, parameters defined through \verb=cli_command= are not read, parsed or imported by the Ebi framework.
					An example of an optional attribute can be found in \verb=ebi_commands/ebi_command_association.rs=.
					
					\item \verb=exact_arithmetic= indicates whether your plug-in \emph{can} handle exact arithmetic. 
					That is, even if this is \verb=true=, the user can still disable exact arithmetic (which will be handled by Ebi).
					The far majority of plug-ins support exact arithmetic; only set this to \verb=false= if exact arithmetic is unbearably slow.
					
					\item \verb=input_types= gives a sequence of inputs.
					That is, the number of inputs is fixed per command (unless through \verb=cli_command=).
					Each input is again a list of possible traits or objects that can be accepted.
					For each input, Ebi will try to parse the file given, and return the first trait/object type using which the file can be parsed.
					
					\item \verb=execute= should call the implemented algorithm.
					As a first step, the inputs should be retrieved from the variable \verb=inputs=, and transformed into the correct types.
					Ebi tests the \verb=execute= function automatally, see Section~\ref{sec:tests}.
					
					The output of the algorithm should be wrapped in the appropriate \verb=EbiOutput= enum.
					
					\item \verb=output_type= indicates the single output type of the command.
                    Ebi automatally tests whether the output of \verb=execute= matches the declared \verb=output_type=; see Section~\ref{sec:tests}.
					
				\end{itemize}
				
				For our example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, style=boxed]		
pub const CONFORMANCE_UEMSC: EbiCommand = EbiCommand::Command {
    name_short: "uemsc",
    name_long: ... , 
    explanation_short: ... , 
    explanation_long: ... , 
    latex_link: ... , 
    cli_command: None, 
    exact_arithmetic: true, 
    input_types: &[ 
        &[&EbiInputType::Trait(EbiTrait::FiniteStochasticLanguage)], 
        &[&EbiInputType::Trait(EbiTrait::QueriableStochasticLanguage)]
    ], 
    input_names: &["FILE_1", "FILE_2"], 
    input_helps: &[
    	"A finite stochastic language (log) to compare.", 
    	"A queriable stochastic language (model) to compare."
    ],
    execute: |mut inputs, _| {
        let log = 
        	inputs.remove(0).to_type::<dyn EbiTraitFiniteStochasticLanguage>()?;
        let model =
        	inputs.remove(0).to_type::<dyn EbiTraitQueriableStochasticLanguage>()?;
        let uemsc =
        	log.unit_earth_movers_stochastic_conformance(model)
        	.context("cannot compute uEMSC")?;
        Ok(EbiOutput::Fraction(uemsc))
    },
    output_type: &EbiOutputType::Fraction
};
\end{lstlisting}
				
				\item Add your command to the higher-level command.		
				At the top of the file, there is a command declaration (e.g. \verb=EBI_CONFORMANCE=) that contains the sub-commands.
				Add your new command here, while maintaining the alphabetical order.
			\end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Tests}
        \label{sec:tests}
            Ebi automatically tests each command, importer, exporter, graphable and infoable, if a corresponding test file is provided in the \verb=testfiles= folder.
            Files with \verb=_invalid= in their file names must not be importable using any importer, that is, importing should give an error message for the test to pass.

            Ebi tests every command automatally.
            The following commands will however \emph{not} be tested automatically:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A command that manipulates the command-line interface (i.e. \verb=cli_command= is not \verb=None=);
            \end{itemize}
            The automated command test will fail if either:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item There is no (combination of) test files in the \verb=testfiles= folder that allows the command to be run.
                \item The \verb=execute= function of the command panics.
                Note that it is fine to return an error message, as this is normal behaviour.
                \item The \verb=execute= function returns an object that does not match the \verb=output_type= field of the command.
                \item The total time of all the command tests together exceeds 5 minutes.
            \end{itemize}
            Note that every combination of files in the \verb=testfiles= folder to which the command applies is tested.
            Tests will be performed using all applicable arithmetic modes (exact/approximate) for each command, thus respecting the \verb=exact_arithmetic= command parameter.

            Further tests can (and should) be located at the bottom of the relevant source file, following Rust conventions.
            For instance:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, style=boxed]
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use std::fs;

    #[test]
    fn a_test() {
        let fin = fs::read_to_string("testfiles/aa.ptree").unwrap();
        let tree = fin.parse::<ProcessTree>().unwrap();
        ... here comes the test ...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

            Tests can be run using \verb=cargo test=, and test coverage can be obtained using \verb=cargo llvm-cov --html=.
		

    \subsection{Exact Computation}
    \label{sec:exact}
        In Ebi, several computations are performed without rounding.
        To this end, it uses positive fractions: 
        $$\mathbb{Q} = \{ \frac{x}{y} \mid x, y \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
    
        Fractions are well-supported by standard libraries.
        Even for seemingly small fractions, the natural numbers that compose the fraction can get \emph{huge}.
        Therefore, simple 32 or 64 bit integers do not suffice for $x$ and $y$, and a large, unbounded, integer library is necessary.
    
        By default, Ebi uses exact arithmetic, unless it is disabled by a function explicitly.
        This can be done with \verb=Fraction::set_exact_globally(exact: bool)=.
        Please note that exact and approximate (double precision) arithmetic cannot be combined, thus functions should set this function as early as possible.

        \subsubsection{Square roots}
            Square roots can only be expressed in $\mathbb{N}$ or in $\mathbb{I}$.
            Thus, we need to represent square roots symbolically.
            For this, we use the following operations:
            \begin{align*}
                \frac{a}{b} ={}& \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{b^2}}\\
                \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b} ={}& \sqrt{a b}\\
                \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} ={}& \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
            \end{align*}
    
            Thus, we can represent all of these square root operations with the square root of a fractional number.

        \subsubsection{Logdiv}
            Logarithms can often not be expressed in $\mathbb{Q}$.
            For instance, $\log_2(3) \notin \mathbb{Q}$ is not a rational number.
            To perform computations exactly and to delay rounding to the very last moment, Ebi uses \emph{log division} objects.
            That is, computations that involve logarithms are performed symbolically in order not to have to evaluate the logarithm.
            
            A log division object ($\logdiv$) is a base-2 logarithm of a positive fraction, divided by a natural number:
            \begin{align*}
                \logdiv &{}\colon \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{I}\\
                \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) &{}= \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c}\\
                &{}= \log \sqrt[\leftroot{-1}\uproot{2}\scriptstyle c]{\frac{a}{b}}
            \end{align*}

            \paragraph{From a fraction}
                Any non-negative fraction can be written as a $\logdiv$:
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{a}{b} ={}& \frac{\log(2^a)}{b} \\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{2^a}{1}, b)
                \end{align*}
    
            \paragraph{Sum \& Difference}
                $\Logdiv$s are closed under addition:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) + \logdiv(\frac{d}{e}, f) = {}& 
                    \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c} + \frac{\log(\frac{d}{e})}{f}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{f\log(\frac{a}{b}) + c\log(\frac{d}{e})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f}) + \log(\frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f d^c}{b^f e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^f d^c}{b^f e^c}, cf)
                \end{align*}
                As $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ and $f$ are all positive integers, the sum of two $\logdiv$s is also a $\logdiv$.
                Similarly, for subtraction:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) - \logdiv(\frac{d}{e}, f) = {}& 
                    \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c} - \frac{\log(\frac{d}{e})}{f}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f}) - \log(\frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f} / \frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^f e^c}{b^f d^c}, cf)\\
                \end{align*}
                As $a$, $b$, $d$ and $e$ are all positive integers, the difference between two $\logdiv$s is also a $\logdiv$.

            \paragraph{Additive identity (0)}
                The additive identity of $\logdiv$ is $\logdiv(\frac{1}{1}, 1) = 0$.
                
                While there are infinitely many $\logdiv$s that equal 0, such as $\logdiv(\frac{5}{5}, 100) = 0$, only a second argument of 1 guarantees that addition and subtraction work as intended.
                
            \paragraph{$n \log n$}
                Given a fraction $\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}$, the value $\frac{a}{b} \log \frac{a}{b}$ can be represented by
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{a}{b} \log \frac{a}{b} ={} & 
                    \frac{a \log(\frac{a}{b})}{b}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^a}{b^a})}{b}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^a}{b^a}, b)\\
                \end{align*}

            \paragraph{Approximation}
                In order to provide readable results that can be used in other tools, at the end of the computation chain, $\logdiv$s need to be approximated to a fraction.
                To this end, we consider that:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) ={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c}
                \end{align*}
    
                Thus, we need to compute $\log(q)$ with $q \in \mathbb{Q}$.
                As the libraries we use do not support computing logarithms on fractions with arbitrary large representations, we must implement this ourselves.

                \subparagraph{Taylor expansion}
                    Using Taylor expansion, we translate the approximation of the logarithm base 2 to $q$ to smaller and smaller values, until we end up with a $q' \leq 2$.
                    That is, we repeatedly divide $q$ by two and add one to the result, until $q$ drops below 2.
                    Then, we can approximate $\log_2(q)$ with a Taylor series on the natural logarithm\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm}}.
                    
                    \begin{align*}
                        \log(q) ={}& \begin{cases}
                            1 + \log(\frac{q}{2}) & \text{ if } q > 2\\ 
                            \frac{\ln(q)}{\ln(2)} & \text{ if } 0 < q \leq 2
                        \end{cases}\\
                        \ln(q) ={}& \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{(z-1)^k}{k} \text{ for } 0 < q \leq 2
                    \end{align*}
                    We then approximate $\ln(q)$ up until the terms become small enough for the required precision.

                \subparagraph{Bits}
                    As even standard multiplications are expensive for fractions, we need a more efficient strategy to bring the approximation to acceptable speed:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item If $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{1}{2}$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b}) ={}& \log(a) - \log(b)\\
                            {}={}& -(\log(b) - \log(a))\\
                            {}={}& -\log(\frac{b}{a})
                        \end{align*}
                        In which $\frac{b}{a}$ is larger than 2.
    
                        Complexity: pointer swap.
                        
                        \item While $\frac{a}{b} > 1$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b}) ={}& \begin{cases}
                                1 + \log(\frac{a}{2b}) & \text{if } a \text{ is odd}\\
                                1 + \log(\frac{a/2}{b}) & \text{if } a \text{ is even} \end{cases}
                        \end{align*}
                        Complexity: for each iteration a left or right bit shift plus a comparison (right bit shift).
                        
                        \item Then, $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{a}{b} < 1$.
                        %https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1706939/approximation-log-2x
                        As $a$ and $b$ may be \emph{huge}, we cannot easily translate our fraction to a standard floating-point number.
                        Therefore, we use the following procedure to obtain as many digits as necessary for the required precision (where 3.3 bits yield one decimal):
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b})_n ={}& \begin{cases}
                                1 & \text{if } a = b\\
                                \log(\frac{a^2}{2 b^2})_{n+1} - \frac{1}{2^n} & \text{if } \frac{a^2}{b^2} > 2 \qquad \text{report a binary } 1\\
                                \log(\frac{a^2}{b^2})_{n+1} & \text{otherwise} \qquad \text{report a binary } 0\\
                            \end{cases}
                        \end{align*}
                        In which $n$ denotes the iteration.
    
                        Complexity: two multiplications and at most one bit shift per bit precision.
                        As multiplications are prohibitively expensive, and squaring roughly doubles the number of bits each iteration, we truncate $a$ and $b$ by the same number of bit-shifts every iteration, such that in each number enough bits are left.
                    \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{RootLogDiv}
            A RootLogDiv is the following:
            \begin{align*}
                \text{RootLogDiv}(\frac{a}{b},c) ={}& \sqrt{\logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c)}\\
                {}={}& \sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{a}{b}}{c}}& 
            \end{align*}

            There is an option to perform the 1- operation on a RootLogDiv.
