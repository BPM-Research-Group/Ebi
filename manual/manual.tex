\section{Architecture}

    \subsection{Files and objects}
        Figure~\ref{fig:traits} shows the main architectural concepts of Ebi with regards to files and objects.
        It's a bit verbose, but it enables commands to be completely detached from any I/O, and reduces overhead when adding new functionality, and guarantees the documentation is up-to-date.

        \subsubsection{Command}
            A command is a function of Ebi that users can call.
            A command declares what types of inputs it needs and what type of output it generates. 
            Preferably, commands take traits as inputs rather than object types.
    
            Commands can circumvent the Ebi object handling on their inputs by declaring an \texttt{cli\_command} function, which gives direct access to the command line interface building process.
            This is for instance used in the \ebiCommand{validate} command, where we want to obtain the parsing error for a particular object type.
    
            The actual input for a command gets wrapped in the \texttt{EbiInput} enum, and the output must be wrapped in the \texttt{EbiOutput} enum.
            The Ebi machinery verifies whether the output of a command matches the declared output type at run time.
            
            Commands define a number of inputs, and for each input a list of acceptable types.
            However, these types need to be similar: a command cannot ask for either a file and a fraction, for instance.
    
            Ebi has the following commands:
            \ebicommandlist
    
        \subsubsection{Input type}
            An input type is a declaration of what a command needs as input.
            An input type can be:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a trait;
                \item an object type;
                \item a basic data type such as fraction, integer or string;
                \item the ``any object" input type, which denotes that any object type will be accepted;
                \item a ``file handler", which indicates the (name of) a file handler (for instance used in the \ebiCommand{validate} command).
            \end{itemize}
    
            The actual input for a command gets wrapped in the \texttt{EbiInput} enum.
    
        \subsubsection{Trait}
            A ``trait" is like an interface: it provides some functions but does not say how these are implemented.
            For instance ``finite stochastic language" is a trait, which allows to iterate over traces and their probabilities, and to obtain the number of traces.
            Preferably, commands should require traits as inputs.

            Ebi has the following traits:
            \ebitraitlist
    
        \subsubsection{Object type}
            An object type is a struct or class.
            It is a specific implementation with a fixed data structure.
            The output of a command is an object of a specific object type.
            The input of a command rather not uses object types, but sometimes this is unavoidable.
            Objects are wrapped in an \texttt{EbiObject} enum to ensure type safety by the compiler.

            Ebi has the following object types:
            \ebiobjecttypelist
    
        \subsubsection{File handler}
            A file handler is an importer for a particular file format.
            In Ebi, a file handler defines how a file type is to be handled, and as which objects and traits it can be imported.
    
            Ebi has the following file handlers:
            \ebifilehandlerlist

    \subsection{Exact Computation}
        In Ebi, several computations are performed without rounding.
        To this end, it uses positive fractions: 
        $$\mathbb{Q} = \{ \frac{x}{y} \mid x, y \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
    
        Fractions are well-supported by standard libraries.
        Even for seemingly small fractions, the natural numbers that compose the fraction can get \emph{huge}.
        Therefore, simple 32 or 64 bit integers do not suffice for $x$ and $y$, and a large, unbounded, integer library is necessary.
    
        By default, Ebi uses exact arithmetic, unless it is disabled by a function explicitly.
        This can be done with \verb=Fraction::set_exact_globally(exact: bool)=.
        Please note that exact and approximate (double precision) arithmetic cannot be combined, thus functions should set this function as early as possible.

        \subsubsection{Square roots}
            Square roots can only be expressed in $\mathbb{N}$ or in $\mathbb{I}$.
            Thus, we need to represent square roots symbolically.
            For this, we use the following operations:
            \begin{align*}
                \frac{a}{b} ={}& \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{b^2}}\\
                \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b} ={}& \sqrt{a b}\\
                \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} ={}& \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
            \end{align*}
    
            Thus, we can represent all of these square root operations with the square root of a fractional number.

        \subsubsection{Logdiv}
            Logarithms can often not be expressed in $\mathbb{Q}$.
            For instance, $\log_2(3) \notin \mathbb{Q}$ is not a rational number.
            To perform computations exactly and to delay rounding to the very last moment, Ebi uses \emph{log division} objects.
            That is, computations that involve logarithms are performed symbolically in order not to have to evaluate the logarithm.
            
            A log division object ($\logdiv$) is a base-2 logarithm of a positive fraction, divided by a natural number:
            \begin{align*}
                \logdiv &{}\colon \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{I}\\
                \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) &{}= \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c}\\
                &{}= \log \sqrt[\leftroot{-1}\uproot{2}\scriptstyle c]{\frac{a}{b}}
            \end{align*}

            \paragraph{From a fraction}
                Any non-negative fraction can be written as a $\logdiv$:
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{a}{b} ={}& \frac{\log(2^a)}{b} \\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{2^a}{1}, b)
                \end{align*}
    
            \paragraph{Sum \& Difference}
                $\Logdiv$s are closed under addition:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) + \logdiv(\frac{d}{e}, f) = {}& 
                    \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c} + \frac{\log(\frac{d}{e})}{f}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{f\log(\frac{a}{b}) + c\log(\frac{d}{e})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f}) + \log(\frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f d^c}{b^f e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^f d^c}{b^f e^c}, cf)
                \end{align*}
                As $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ and $f$ are all positive integers, the sum of two $\logdiv$s is also a $\logdiv$.
                Similarly, for subtraction:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) - \logdiv(\frac{d}{e}, f) = {}& 
                    \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c} - \frac{\log(\frac{d}{e})}{f}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f}) - \log(\frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^f}{b^f} / \frac{d^c}{e^c})}{cf}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^f e^c}{b^f d^c}, cf)\\
                \end{align*}
                As $a$, $b$, $d$ and $e$ are all positive integers, the difference between two $\logdiv$s is also a $\logdiv$.

            \paragraph{Additive identity (0)}
                The additive identity of $\logdiv$ is $\logdiv(\frac{1}{1}, 1) = 0$.
                
                While there are infinitely many $\logdiv$s that equal 0, such as $\logdiv(\frac{5}{5}, 100) = 0$, only a second argument of 1 guarantees that addition and subtraction work as intended.
                
            \paragraph{$n \log n$}
                Given a fraction $\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}$, the value $\frac{a}{b} \log \frac{a}{b}$ can be represented by
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{a}{b} \log \frac{a}{b} ={} & 
                    \frac{a \log(\frac{a}{b})}{b}\\
                    {}={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a^a}{b^a})}{b}\\
                    {}={}& \logdiv(\frac{a^a}{b^a}, b)\\
                \end{align*}

            \paragraph{Approximation}
                In order to provide readable results that can be used in other tools, at the end of the computation chain, $\logdiv$s need to be approximated to a fraction.
                To this end, we consider that:
                \begin{align*}
                    \logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c) ={}& \frac{\log(\frac{a}{b})}{c}
                \end{align*}
    
                Thus, we need to compute $\log(q)$ with $q \in \mathbb{Q}$.
                As the libraries we use do not support computing logarithms on fractions with arbitrary large representations, we must implement this ourselves.

                \subparagraph{Taylor expansion}
                    Using Taylor expansion, we translate the approximation of the logarithm base 2 to $q$ to smaller and smaller values, until we end up with a $q' \leq 2$.
                    That is, we repeatedly divide $q$ by two and add one to the result, until $q$ drops below 2.
                    Then, we can approximate $\log_2(q)$ with a Taylor series on the natural logarithm\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm}}.
                    
                    \begin{align*}
                        \log(q) ={}& \begin{cases}
                            1 + \log(\frac{q}{2}) & \text{ if } q > 2\\ 
                            \frac{\ln(q)}{\ln(2)} & \text{ if } 0 < q \leq 2
                        \end{cases}\\
                        \ln(q) ={}& \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{(z-1)^k}{k} \text{ for } 0 < q \leq 2
                    \end{align*}
                    We then approximate $\ln(q)$ up until the terms become small enough for the required precision.

                \subparagraph{Bits}
                    As even standard multiplications are expensive for fractions, we need a more efficient strategy to bring the approximation to acceptable speed:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item If $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{1}{2}$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b}) ={}& \log(a) - \log(b)\\
                            {}={}& -(\log(b) - \log(a))\\
                            {}={}& -\log(\frac{b}{a})
                        \end{align*}
                        In which $\frac{b}{a}$ is larger than 2.
    
                        Complexity: pointer swap.
                        
                        \item While $\frac{a}{b} > 1$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b}) ={}& \begin{cases}
                                1 + \log(\frac{a}{2b}) & \text{if } a \text{ is odd}\\
                                1 + \log(\frac{a/2}{b}) & \text{if } a \text{ is even} \end{cases}
                        \end{align*}
                        Complexity: for each iteration a left or right bit shift plus a comparison (right bit shift).
                        
                        \item Then, $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{a}{b} < 1$.
                        %https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1706939/approximation-log-2x
                        As $a$ and $b$ may be \emph{huge}, we cannot easily translate our fraction to a standard floating-point number.
                        Therefore, we use the following procedure to obtain as many digits as necessary for the required precision (where 3.3 bits yield one decimal):
                        \begin{align*}
                            \log(\frac{a}{b})_n ={}& \begin{cases}
                                1 & \text{if } a = b\\
                                \log(\frac{a^2}{2 b^2})_{n+1} - \frac{1}{2^n} & \text{if } \frac{a^2}{b^2} > 2 \qquad \text{report a binary } 1\\
                                \log(\frac{a^2}{b^2})_{n+1} & \text{otherwise} \qquad \text{report a binary } 0\\
                            \end{cases}
                        \end{align*}
                        In which $n$ denotes the iteration.
    
                        Complexity: two multiplications and at most one bit shift per bit precision.
                        As multiplications are prohibitively expensive, and squaring roughly doubles the number of bits each iteration, we truncate $a$ and $b$ by the same number of bit-shifts every iteration, such that in each number enough bits are left.
                    \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{RootLogDiv}
            A RootLogDiv is the following:
            \begin{align*}
                \text{RootLogDiv}(\frac{a}{b},c) ={}& \sqrt{\logdiv(\frac{a}{b}, c)}\\
                {}={}& \sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{a}{b}}{c}}& 
            \end{align*}

            There is an option to perform the 1- operation on a RootLogDiv.
        
    \section{Entropic Relevance}
    \label{sec:er}
        Entropic relevance is computed as follows:
        
        \begin{definition}[Entropic Relevance~\cite{DBLP:journals/is/AlkhammashPMG22}]
            \label{def:ER}
                Let $L$ be a finite stochastic language and let $M$ be a queriable stochastic langauge.
                Let $\Lambda$ be the set of all activities appearing in the traces of $L$.
                Then, the \emph{entropic relevance ($\entrel$) of $M$ to $L$} is defined as follows: 
                \begin{align*}
                    \entrel(L, M) ={}& H_0\left(\sum_{\sigma \in \bar{L},\, M(\sigma)>0}{L(\sigma)}\right) + 
                    \sum_{\sigma \in \bar{L}}L(\sigma) J(\sigma, M)\\
